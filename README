silc-toolkit
------------------------------------------
SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which provides 
secure conferencing services on the Internet over insecure channel. SILC 
is IRC-like software although internally they are very different. The 
biggest similarity between SILC and IRC is that they both provide 
conferencing services and that SILC has almost the same commands as IRC.  
Other than that they are nothing alike.  Major differences are that SILC 
is secure what IRC is not in any way.  The network model is also 
entirely different compared to IRC.

This package provides the SILC protocol libraries.
